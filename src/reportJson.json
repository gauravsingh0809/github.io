			"Para27": "This investment accounts for 4.86 per cent of the GSDP of the State during 2021-22, where loan component alone accounts for nearly 3.81 per cent. It has been observed that one of the key indicators of financial distress of the DISCOMs is mounting power purchase dues towards the Generation Companies. The delayed payments by DISCOMs are considered as one of the major reasons for financial stress. To overcome this distress, GoI had launched the Late Payment Surcharge Rules, 2022, which had enabled the Distribution companies to pay the dues in equated monthly installments. The overdue amount for generating companies engaged in conventional generation in Karnataka was ₹20,182.39 crore  as of March 2021. It is observed that cumulative overdue amount payable to generating companies at the end of December 2022  was ₹19,133.49 crore , which is indicative of the fact that over a period of 21 months, the overdue amount was reduced by 5.20 per cent. ",
			"Para28": "The GoK extended no loans during the period 2019-20 to 2021-22 to the Generation Companies hence no amount was recovered at the end of March 2022. Since, the loan component to the Generation Companies account was nil, there is no impact on the fiscal deficit of the State.",

			"Para44": "Interest coverage ratio is used to determine the ability of a company to pay interest on outstanding debt and is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by interest expenses of the same period.  The lower the ratio, the lesser is the                     ability of the company to pay interest on debt.  An interest coverage ratio of below one indicates that the company was not generating sufficient revenues to meet its expenses on  interest.  The details of interest coverage ratio in SPSEs which had interest burden are given below in Table-5.7.",

			"Para55": "Return on Equity (RoE) is a measure of financial performance to assess how effectively a  company’s assets are being used to create profits. RoE is calculated by dividing net income (i.e. net profit after taxes) by shareholders’ fund. It is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company if net income and shareholders’ fund are both positive numbers.",
			"Para56": "Shareholders’ fund is calculated by adding paid up capital and free reserves minus net of accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure and reveals how much would be left for a company’s stakeholders if all assets were sold and all debts paid. A positive shareholders fund reveals that the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities while    negative shareholder equity means liabilities exceed assets. ",

			"Para66": "Further, out of the total equity and loans in the 34 companies, 96.25 per cent of equity and 52.82 per cent of loan constituted in Power and Transport sectors. State Governments are the sole owners of the Power sector entities and the Government Departments undertakings of the State provide public transport services. The financial health of the power sector entity especially directly affects the fiscal position of the States. Since these two sectors contributed to majority of the losses in SPSEs, the XIV FC in addition to recommending to address the inefficiencies in the SPSEs suggested for establishment of State Electricity Regulatory Commission Fund for providing financial autonomy to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission and setting up of independent regulatory authority for Transport sector. In respect of other SPSEs, it upheld the recommendation of XIII FC to draw a road map for closure of non-working companies. ",

		"Para104d": "A new process called Partial Subscriber Contribution File(SCF) upload has been affected to overcome the rejection of SCF due to error",
		"Para105": "2.5.2.6 Interest Payments",
		"Para106": "Interest payments increased by ₹11,303 crore (75 per cent) from ₹14,973 crore in 2017-18 to ₹26,276 crore in 2021-22.  When compared to 2020-21, the interest payment increased by 12.13 per cent. Interest payments during 2021-22 constituted interest on internal debt (₹21,549 crore), interest on small savings, provident fund etc., (₹2,973 crore), interest on Loans and Advances from the Central Government (₹418 crore), interest on off-budget borrowings (₹1,292 crore), interest on Reserve Funds (₹43 crore) and interest on other obligations (₹1 crore).",
		"Para107": "The interest on internal debt increased by 16 per cent from ₹18,627 crore in 2020-21 to ₹21,549 crore in 2021-22, on account of increase in payment of interest on market loans by ₹3,107 crore (18 per cent).  The interest on Loans and Advances from Central Government decreased by ₹114 crore from ₹532 crore during 2020-21 to ₹418 crore in 2021-22, mainly on account of decrease under interest of Loans for State/Union Territory Plan scheme (21 per cent).",
		"Para108": "2.5.2.7 Subsidies",
		"Para109": "There was an increase in expenditure on subsidies during the year 2021-22 as can be seen from the details given in Table 2.18. While subsidies as a percentage of Revenue Receipts increased from 12 per cent in 2020-21 to 14 per cent in 2021-22, as percentage of Revenue Expenditure increased from 10 per cent in 2020-21 to 13 per cent in 2021-22.",
		"Para10a": "Table 2.3 provides trends in Revenue Receipts as well as revenue buoyancy with respect to GSDP over the five-year period 2017-18 to 2021-22.  Further, trends in Revenue Receipts relative to GSDP and composition of Revenue Receipts are given in Chart 2.4 and Chart 2.5 respectively.",
		"Para11": "General trends relating to Revenue Receipts of the State are as follows:",
		"Para110": "The four largest subsidy components were power subsidy provided for supply of free electricity to farmers for usage of agricultural pump sets, food subsidy, interest subsidy for crop loans and transport.  The details for the last five years are shown in Appendix 2.3 and for 2021-22 the same is shown in Chart 2.11.",
		"Para111": "Subsidies in the form of financial assistance, incentives etc",
		"Para112": "Subsidies provided by the State Government could be of two kinds i,e Explicit   and Implicit subsidy. Implicit subsidy is one where the State provides for expenditure in nature of subsidy and the other where grants are provided for certain schemes of the Government.  These subsidies can be indirect, in kind or take the shape of tax concessions.",
		"Para113": "These subsidies in the form of financial assistance increased from ₹3,318 crore in 2017-18 to ₹3,698 crore during 2021-22.  They mainly include financial assistance for supply of seeds, weaver’s package, Ashraya scheme, micro/drip irrigation, minimum floor price scheme, Vajpayee Urban Housing Scheme etc. These subsidies extended during 2017-18 to 2021-22 are detailed in Appendix 2.4. Thus, if the subsidies in the form of financial assistance were taken into account, the actual expenditure on subsidies would increase to ₹31,917 crore. The Economic Survey 2021-22 states that there is a need to assess the entire grant of State investment in different State Public Sector Enterprises(SPSEs) as the returns from the PSEs is less than one per cent. Since the investments are made from the borrowings the holding cost at seven per cent work out to ₹4,946 crore which is in the form of implicit subsidy.",

The assistance to PRIs increased from ₹31,054.63 crore during 2017-18 to ₹39,835.19 crore during 2021-22 and ULBs increased from ₹6,489.76 crore during 2017-18 to ₹6,615.83 crore during 2021-22.",
		"Para118": "Out of the total devolution of ₹39,835 crore to PRIs during 2021-22, ₹18,502 crore (46 per cent) was towards salaries. The higher allocation towards Salaries mainly due to the State Government’s functions viz., education, water supply and sanitation, housing, health and family welfare etc., were transferred to PRIs.  It also included ₹1,655.61 crore XV FC grants released to the Zilla Panchayats (₹79.36 crore), Gram Panchayats (₹1,411.40 crore) and Taluk Panchayats (₹164.85 crore).",
		"Para119": "The assistance to ULBs increased by ₹934.79 crore over the previous year which includes salary component also.   Out of ₹6,615.83 crore assistance to ULBs, ₹1,070.00 crore (16 per cent) was towards creation of capital assets.  It also includes XIV FC grants released to the State Government (₹1,029.50 crore).",
		"Para12": "Revenue Receipts increased by 33.17 per cent from ₹1,47,000 crore in 2017-18 to ₹1,95,762 crore in 2021-22. During 2021-22, the Revenue Receipt increased by 18.96 per cent when compared to previous year.",
		"Para119a": "Other Institutions",
		"Para120": "During 2021-22, assistance to other institutions (₹8,590.60 crore) included assistance to Statutory bodies and Development Authorities (₹2,564 crore), NGOs (₹1,902 crore), PSUs (₹34 crore) and others (₹4,090 crore) which are detailed in Table 2.20.  The assistance to Co-operatives and other institutions increased by ₹220 crore and ₹934 crore respectively and for Education Institutions there was a marginal decrease of ₹six crore as compared to the previous year.",
		"Para120a": "The devolutions to the local bodies were analysed with respect to the recommendations made by Fourth State Finance Commission and the findings are discussed below:",
		"Para120b": "The Articles 243 (I) and (Y) of the Constitution of India read with the section 267 of the Karnataka Grama Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act 1993 as amended in 2015 and section 503C of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 and section 302B of Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 provided for the formation of State Finance Commission (SFC) to address the financial issues confronted by the PRIs and ULBs. The SFCs have to look after the fiscal problems of both PRIs and ULBs. Before this mechanism came into existence, the State Governments used to transfer funds to local bodies based on State laws and discretion. The Governor of a state shall within one year from the 73rd (1992) amendment to the Constitution under Article 243(I), and thereafter at the expiry of every fifth year constitute SFC to review the financial position of panchayats and similarly, the SFC constituted under Article 243 (Y) of the 74th amendment shall also review the financial position of the municipalities and make recommendations to the Governor.",
		"Para120c": "The Governor of Karnataka has, so far, appointed four SFCs. The details of the SFCs are given in Table 2.20(a).",
		"Para120d": "Since there was delay in constitution of Fourth SFC, the period of Third SFC was extended upto 2017-18.  The recommendations of the Fourth Finance Commission are:",
		"Para120e": "The allocation of financial resources between the State and the local bodies in the first instance and among the PRIs and the ULBs and among these bodies interse in the later stages of devolution. The actual devolutions are to be based on the Non Loan Net Own Revenue Receipts (NLNORR) allocations with base year as 2018-19 and thereafter every year.",
		"Para120f": "In the first level devolution which is relative share of State and local bodies in NLNORR, the shares of the State and the local bodies are to be in the ratio of 52:48 in NLNORR.",
		"Para120g": "In the second level devolution which is relative shares of RLBs and ULBs, out of the share of local bodies at 48 per cent, as determined in the first level, one per cent is to be an additional grant to BBMP. In the remaining 47 per cent, the relative shares of PRIs and ULBs are to be in the ratios of 75:25. This works out to 35.25 per cent rounded off to 35 per cent to PRIs and 11.75 per cent rounded off to 12 per cent to ULBs in the NLNORR.",
		"Para120h": "The third level devolution is inter-se sharing of funds among PRIs tier-wise and among ULBs class-wise and the fourth level devolution is inter-se sharing among each unit in each tier of PRIs and each unit in each class of ULBs.",
		"Para120i": "The first level and second level devolutions are indicated in the Table 2.20(b).  below.",
		"Para120j": "From the table, it is noticed that the share of the local bodies in NLNORR was on an average 32.43 per cent which was much below the recommendation of Fourth SFC of 48 per cent.",		
		"Para120k": "2.5.2.9 COVID-19 Expenditure",
		"Para120l": "Government accounts are presented under a six-tier classification, with Object Head representing purpose/object of expenditure. During on set of COVID-19 pandemic, the budget year of 2019-20 was almost over and budget of 2020-21 was already placed. Hence budget and expenditure towards COVID-19 was impossible. However, during 2020-21 also, no separate object head was designated towards COVID-19. As a result, the allocation as well as expenditure towards COVID-19 was not captured in accounts.",
		"Para120m": "Analysis of funds released and utilised during 2019-20 to 2021-22 for control of COVID-19 in the Department of Health and Family Welfare Services, Medical Education and Revenue are indicated in Table 2.20 (c).",
		"Para120n": "From the table, it is seen that 92 per cent of the amount released have been utilised towards control of COVID 19. The balance ₹521.75 crore which were released to the Departments are remaining unspent with concerned DDOs of the Department.",
		"Para121": "2.5.3 Capital Expenditure",
		"Para122": "Capital Expenditure includes primarily expenditure on creation of fixed infrastructure assets, such as buildings, roads, bridges, etc. Capital Expenditure is met from budgetary support and extra budgetary resources/off-budget.  Of late, the infrastructure requirements have increased manifold and SPVs have been set up to carry out bulk of Capital Expenditure",
		"Para123": "Capital Expenditure (including Disbursement of Loans and Advances) of the State showed an increase from ₹35,760 crore in 2017-18 to ₹48,075 crore in 2020-21.  During 2021-22, the Capital Expenditure increased by ₹4,008 crore from previous year and was at ₹52,083 crore.",
		"Para124": "During the year 2020-21, an amount of ₹217.02 crore (₹100.00 towards grants-in-aid and ₹117.02 towards salaries) was released under capital head instead of revenue head, which resulted in overstatement of capital outlay and thereby resulting in understatement of revenue deficit to that extent (detailed in Chapter 3 Paragraph No.3.7.2.2 & 3.7.2.3). Thus, the actual Capital Expenditure would be ₹47,857.98 crore instead of ₹48,075 crore. Details of Capital Expenditure vis-à-vis budget during the five-year period 2016-17 to 2020-21 are given in Chart 2.12.",
		"Para125": "As seen from the above chart, the actual expenditure was more than the estimated Capital Expenditure during 2017-18, 2020-21 and 2021-22. During 2018-19 and 2019-20, the actual Capital Expenditure was less than the estimate by five per cent and seven per cent respectively. Table 2.21 highlights the cases of significant increase or decrease in various Heads of Account in Capital Outlay during 2021-22 vis-à-vis the previous year.",
		"Para126": "The above table reveals that variation in Capital Expenditure was under Capital Expenditure on Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Minorities (67.80 per cent) followed by Education, Sports, Art and Culture (39.92 per cent).",
		"Para127": "The Finance Department while agreeing to the point of audit, replied (December 2021) that due to the constraints stated below, the prescribed level of Capital Expenditure could not be reached;",
		"Para128": "•Committed expenditure consumed 76 to 94 per cent of Revenue Receipts during 2017-18 to 2020-21 and there was little scope for reduction of expenditure under committed category",
		"Para129": "Grants released for creation of assets to autonomous bodies of State Government were also accounted as Revenue expenditure.",
		"Para13": "About 68 per cent of the Revenue Receipts during 2021-22 came from the State’s own resources, while Central tax transfers and Grants-in-aid together contributed 32 per cent. This is indicative that Karnataka’s fiscal position is largely influenced by own resources.",
		"Para130": "The Expenditure Reforms Commission (ERC) of the State Government, in its first report (February 2010) had recommended that capital investments be stepped up and protected from fiscal uncertainties through prudent allocations.  It had also recommended maintaining the Capital Expenditure (excluding debt servicing) at five per cent of GSDP.  However, the ratio of Capital Expenditure to GSDP was only two to three per cent during 2017-18 to 2021-22.",
		"Para131": "2.5.4 Quality of Capital Expenditure",
		"Para132": "In the post KFRA framework, the Government is expected to keep its fiscal deficit (borrowing) at low levels and still meet its Capital Expenditure/investment (including Loans and Advances) requirements.  In addition, the State Government needs to initiate measures to earn adequate return on its investments rather than bearing the same in the form of subsidy at the cost of borrowed funds and take requisite steps to infuse transparency in financial operations.  This section presents the broad financial analysis of investments and other Capital Expenditure undertaken by the Government during 2021-22 vis-à-vis previous years.",
		"Para133": "2.5.4.1 Investments in Companies, Corporations and other bodies",
		"Para134": "As on 31 March 2022, the Government had invested ₹70,657.43 crore in 91  Government Companies (₹61,059.93 crore), Nine Statutory Corporations (₹3,070.55 crore), 44 Joint Stock Companies (₹6,070.66 crore) and Co-operative Institutions, Local bodies and Regional Rural Banks (₹456.29 crore).  During 2021-22, the Government invested ₹2,400.75 crore as equity, in Government Companies (working) (₹329.25 crore), Joint Stock Company (₹1,933.37 crore), Statutory Corporations (₹136.50 crore) and Co -operation Institutions and Local Bodies (₹1.63 crore). The investment under Statutory Corporations and Government Companies were spread under various sectors.",
		"Para135": "During 2021-22, the investment account was reduced under ‘Co-operative Institutions’ by ₹0.48 crore, due to withdrawal of Government investment in the share capital of institutions, the proceeds of which stand accounted under ‘Miscellaneous Capital Receipts’.",
		"Para136": "•Return on Investment",
		"Para137": "The details of investment as well as its return for the last five years are indicated in Table 2.22.  It is evident from the table that the return on investment is negligible",
		"Para138": "The Return on investment increased from ₹78.83 crore in 2017-18 to ₹349.77 crore in 2021-22 and it has increased by 333.42 per cent when compared to previous year. The increase was mainly under Karnataka State Minerals Corporation Limited (₹140.61 crore), Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development limited (₹86.49 crore), The Hutti Gold Mines Company Limited (₹33.12 crore) etc.,",
		"Para139": "In reply to SFAR of the C&AG of India for the Year ending March 2021, the Finance Department had stated (December 2021) that similar process as in line with the Union Government for collection of dividends from the PSUs earning profit would be followed. As a first step, it stated that department of Public Enterprises had issued guidelines (November 2021) for payment of dividends not less than 30 per cent of the profits earned by the PSUs. As a result, there was increase in the dividend collected. The FMRC also expressed optimism about the dividend income from PSUs.",
		"Para14": "During the year 2021-22, the increase of 24.92 per cent (₹39,046 crore) in Revenue Receipts was mainly due to an increase of 24.41 per cent, 49.19 per cent and 53.42 per cent in own-Tax Revenue, non-Tax Revenue and States share of Union Taxes respectively.",
		"Para140": "•Investment in loss making companies",
		"Para141": "The above investment included ₹42,194.32 crore (60 per cent) in the following Companies/Corporations, which have significant losses and where the investments were substantial (Table 2.23).",
		"Para142": "Up to 2021-22, the Government invested ₹42,194.32 crore in these companies and the cumulative loss accounted for is ₹23,030.09 crore.",
		"Para143": "Finance department in its reply (January 2023) stated that the investment are mainly under the Irrigation, Power and Infrastructure sector, even though they are incurring continuous loss. However, continuation of investment is inevitable as they contribute to increased agriculture production, rural employment and better industrial growth.",
		"Para144": "Further, it stated that due to instruction issued to PSUs to pay dividend at 30 per cent of profit, there was increase in dividend collection during 2021-22. The  action initiated by the Finance Department towards increase in the dividend received is appreciated.",
		"Para145": "However, during 2020-21, Government had invested a very smaller amount in HESCOM (₹20.94 crore), GESCOM (₹5.98 crore) and CESCOM (₹3.68 crore) when compared to previous year.",
		"Para146": "The Finance Department in its reply (Feb 2021) stated that investment in certain Companies (Irrigation and Energy Sector) was inevitable despite companies accumulating loss as it results in creation of infrastructure and employment.",
		"Para147": "2.5.4.2 Loans and advances by the State Government",
		"Para148": "In addition to investments in Companies, Corporations and Co-operative Institutions, the Government also provided Loans and Advances to many institutions.  Table 2.24 presents the position of outstanding Loans and Advances as on 31 March 2022 and interest receipts vis-à-vis interest payments during the last five years.",

These heads of accounts are finally cleared by minus debit or minus credit when the amounts are booked to their respective final heads of accounts.  If these amounts remain un-cleared, the balances under the suspense heads would accumulate and would not reflect the Government’s receipts and expenditure accurately.
